<strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the <em>Branham Computing Puzzles</em>! (BCP for short)  This is a website featuring dozens of programming challenges designed to improve critical thinking, problem solving, and programming skills. Work your way through fun problems to unlock new branches filled with more challenges, all while aiming for the leaderboard.</p>
<p>The format of these problems are inspired by other computing problem sites such as <em>USACO</em> and <em>Advent of Code</em>, but all problems are original and designed by the Branham programming club (Check us out!).</p>
<p>The problem themselves are generally meant to be solved with the aid of code, though if your heart desires, you can solve each problem without even touching your IDE.  However, if you do decide to program the solutions, each problem is guarenteed to have a programmable solution that can run in under 4 seconds in any language.</p>
<p>The input format of the problems presented will be in the form of files containing the problem’s information, and solutions can be entered in in the solutions box.</p>
<p>If you are stuck on a problem, try to look at it from a different angle or start trying out a couple smaller test cases or see if you can relate them to any of the previous knowledge you’ve learned.</p>
<p>If you are really stuck on a problem or have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact us on the Branham programming club Discord at <a href="https://discord.gg/6EtcRdC">https://discord.gg/6EtcRdC</a>!</p>
<p>Below is a simple example problem to get you started.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>Problem 1</strong></p>
<p>Jane has recently decided to quit her stressful job of being a computer scientist to try out the nice, peaceful life of being a rancher, after hearing from her good friend, Farmer John, about all the wacky adventures he’s had on his farm.</p>
<p>After deciding to raise hens on her farm (Cows are far too fussy, after all), Jane has spent the past few weeks making a total of N purchases (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000) to help set up her farm, Jane realized that she had lost track of the total cost of the purchases she made.  The store owners demand Jane to pay the fees by tomorrow, and Jane is frankly really bad at math, so she can’t total all of these costs up.</p>
<p>Please help Jane find the total cost of all the ranch equipments she’s bought.</p>
<p><em>Input</em><br>
The first line of the input file is the integer N, the number of purchases Jane has made.  Each of the next N lines contain a positive integer describing the cost of a piece of equipment.</p>
<p><em>Output</em><br>
Enter into the solutions box the total cost of all the listed equipment.</p>
